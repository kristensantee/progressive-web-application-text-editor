# Progressive Web App - Text Editor

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview
This application is a text editor running in the browser. The application supports data persistence techniques in the event of an unsupported event within the browser and even functions offline. 

## Description
This project was to build a progressive web app that runs in the browser but also offline and is able to be installed to the local machine. The application makes use of a custom service worker, a webpack plugin, a manifest file, and an indexedDB. The text editor will function in a browser but can also be accessed as a seperate app on the local machine once installed and downloaded. In the browser window, the application will continue to display text on browser refresh due to the text being stored in the database. The site is also successfully deployed to heroku with the link available in the Installation section below.
